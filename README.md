# Online Recruitment Fraud Detection (Deep + Classical)

## Overview
Detects fraudulent job postings using text + metadata.
- Baseline: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression / Random Forest
- Deep: Keras BiLSTM on tokenized text
- Outputs fraud probability and decision

## Why it matters
Brief paragraph on trust & safety, scale, and moderation.

## Data
Synthetic dataset generated by `src/train.py`:
- Columns: title, company, location, employment_type, telecommuting, has_company_logo,
  salary_min, salary_max, description, fraudulent
- `text_clean` engineered for modeling

## Quickstart
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/train.py
